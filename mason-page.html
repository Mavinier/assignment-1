                The Blueberry, any of several North American shrubs of the genus Vaccinium (family Ericaceae), prized for their sweet edible fruits. <br>
                Hailed as a superfood, blueberries are an excellent source of dietary fibre, vitamin C, vitamin K, manganese, iron, and a number of antioxidants.

              <h2>Cultivation</h2>
              <p>
                Blueberries prefer full sun, although the plants will tolerate partial shade. <br>
                As shade increases, the bushes produce fewer blossoms, and fruit production declines. <br>
                Blueberries require acidic, well-drained, loose soils with a high organic matter content. <br>
                Plants won't have much fruit the first 2 to 3 years. Harvest is bigger after 5 years. <br>
                Blueberry plants grow slowly and reach full size in 8 to 10 years

            <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
            <p>
              The fiber, potassium, folate, vitamin C, vitamin B6, and phytonutrient content in blueberries supports heart health. <br>
              The absence of cholesterol from blueberries is also beneficial to the heart. <br>
              Fiber content helps to reduce the total amount of cholesterol in the blood and decrease the risk of heart disease.
